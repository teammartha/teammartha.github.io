        <h3>What is pokeheartgold-expanded?</h3>
        <p style="width:75%">
            This project is a decomp hack of Pokemon HeartGold and Pokemon SoulSilver! 
            <br>Because the pokeheartgold project is still fairly work in progress, this project may also develop into a hybrid decomp/ROM hack.
        </p>
        <h3>How will this project be distributed?</h3>
        <p style="width:75%">
            This project currently has no releases, and the distribution method will change depending upon features added.
            <br>The final project will likely be distributed as an IPS patch given the gray area of hosting ROM hacks on GitHub.
            <br>If tools to develop the whole project in decompilation eventually arise, this may change.
        </p>
        <h3>What broad features does it have?</h3>
        <p style="width:75%">
            The design goals of this hack are:
            <br>-- Pokemon new to Gold and Silver (Larvitar, Sneasel, etc.) can be caught before Lance, and Hoenn/Sinnoh Evolutions are now all usable before Lance
            <br>-- Level scaling for routes and major battles improved, with more choices in the early game
            <br>-- Select Kanto/Johto Pokemon receive buffs, making unpowered Pokemon usable in ways mostly consistent with Gamefreak's style of buffing
            <br>-- Helpful resources for teambuilding available more easily (low cost battle items, etc.)
            <br>-- All 493 Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh Pokemon catchable in one game
        </p>
